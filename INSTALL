Known issues
============

Older versions of Doxygen has bugs in the man-page generation which
cause the builtin help to render incorrectly. Version 1.2.14 is known
to have this problem.

In version 1.9.2, the installation prefix for fish rpms and debs has
changed from /usr/local to /usr. The package should automatically
change any instances of /usr/local/bin/fish in /etc/passwd to
/usr/bin/fish, but some programs, like screen, may need to be
restarted to notice the changes.  You may also run into problems when
switching between using a package and personal builds.


Prerequisites
=============

Fish requires the following packages to build:

 - Doxygen
 - Curses or Ncurses

fish also relies on standard unix tools such as cat, cut, grep, sed,
whoami and echo. Fish does not support cross-compilation, separate
build directories or any other fancy configure options. Use a recent
version of Doxygen, since older versions have bugs that make the
builtin help pages render incorrectly. Version 1.2.14 is known to be
broken.


Simple install procedure
========================

 % ./configure
 % make                                  #Compile fish
 % make install                          #Install fish
 % echo /usr/local/bin/fish >>/etc/shells #Add fish to list of shells

If you wish to use fish as your default shell, use the following
command:

 % chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish			 

chsh will prompt you for your password, and change your default shell.


Local install procedure
=======================

To install fish in your own home directory (typically as non-root),
type:

 % ./configure --prefix=$HOME
 % make					# Compile fish
 % make install			# Install fish

You will not be able to use fish as the default shell unless you also
add the corresponding line to /etc/shells, which kind of defeats the
point of a local install. But you can at least build and run fish.
