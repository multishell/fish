.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBfg\fP brings the specified job to the foreground, resuming it if it is stopped. While a foreground job is executed, fish is suspended. If no job is specified, the last job to be used is put in the foreground. If \fBPID\fP is specified, the job containing a process with the specified process ID is put in the foreground.
.sp
For compatibility with other shells, job expansion syntax is supported for \fBfg\fP\&. A \fBPID\fP of the format \fB%1\fP will foreground job 1. Job numbers can be seen in the output of jobs\&.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
\fBfg\fP will put the last job in the foreground.
.sp
\fBfg %3\fP will put job 3 into the foreground.
