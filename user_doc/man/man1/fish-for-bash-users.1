.sp
This is to give you a quick overview if you come from bash (or to a lesser extent other shells like zsh or ksh) and want to know how fish differs. Fish is intentionally not POSIX\-compatible and as such some of the things you are used to work differently.
.sp
Many things are similar \- they both fundamentally expand commandlines to execute commands, have pipes, redirections, variables, globs, use command output in various ways. This document is there to quickly show you the differences.
.SH COMMAND SUBSTITUTIONS
.sp
Fish spells command substitutions as \fB(command)\fP instead of \fB$(command)\fP (or \fB\(gacommand\(ga\fP).
.sp
In addition, it only splits them on newlines instead of $IFS. If you want to split on something else, use string split, string split0 or string collect\&. If those are used as the last command in a command substitution the splits they create are carried over. So:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
for i in (find . \-print0 | string split0)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will correctly handle all possible filenames.
.SH VARIABLES
.sp
Fish sets and erases variables with set instead of \fBVAR=VAL\fP and \fBdeclare\fP and \fBunset\fP and \fBexport\fP\&. \fBset\fP takes options to determine the scope and exportedness of a variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define $PAGER global and exported, so this is like \(ga\(gaexport PAGER=less\(ga\(ga
set \-gx PAGER less

# Define $alocalvariable only locally \- like \(ga\(galocal alocalvariable=foo\(ga\(ga
set \-l alocalvariable foo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or to erase variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set \-e PAGER
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBVAR=VAL\fP statements are available as environment overrides:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
PAGER=cat git log
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish does not perform word splitting. Once a variable has been set to a value, that value stays as it is, so double\-quoting variable expansions isn\(aqt the necessity it is in bash. [1]
.sp
For instance, here\(aqs bash
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> foo="bar baz"
> printf \(aq"%s"\en\(aq $foo # will print two lines, because we didn\(aqt double\-quote, so the variable is split
"bar"
"baz"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And here is fish:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> set foo "bar baz"
> printf \(aq"%s"\en\(aq $foo # foo was set as one element, so it will be passed as one element, so this is one line
"bar baz"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All variables are "arrays" (we use the term "lists"), and expanding a variable expands to all its elements, with each element as its own argument (like bash\(aqs \fB"${var[@]}"\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> set var "foo bar" banana
> printf %s\en $var
foo bar
banana
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specific elements of a list can be selected:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo $list[5..7]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP [1] 5
zsh also does not perform word splitting by default (the SH_WORD_SPLIT option controls this)
.SH WILDCARDS (GLOBS)
.sp
Fish only supports the \fB*\fP and \fB**\fP glob (and the deprecated \fB?\fP glob). If a glob doesn\(aqt match it fails the command (like with bash\(aqs \fBfailglob\fP) unless the command is \fBfor\fP, \fBset\fP or \fBcount\fP or the glob is used with an environment override (\fBVAR=* command\fP), in which case it expands to nothing (like with bash\(aqs \fBnullglob\fP option).
.sp
Globbing doesn\(aqt happen on expanded variables, so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set foo "*"
echo $foo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will not match any files.
.sp
There are no options to control globbing so it always behaves like that.
.SH QUOTING
.sp
Fish has two quoting styles: \fB""\fP and \fB\(aq\(aq\fP\&. Variables are expanded in double\-quotes, nothing is expanded in single\-quotes.
.sp
There is no \fB$\(aq\(aq\fP, instead the sequences that would transform are transformed \fIwhen unquoted\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> echo a\enb
a
b
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH STRING MANIPULATION
.sp
Fish does not have \fB${foo%bar}\fP, \fB${foo#bar}\fP and \fB${foo/bar/baz}\fP\&. Instead string manipulation is done by the string builtin.
.SH SPECIAL VARIABLES
.sp
Some bash variables and their closest fish equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$*\fP, \fB$@\fP, \fB$1\fP and so on: \fB$argv\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$?\fP: \fB$status\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$$\fP: \fB$fish_pid\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$#\fP: No variable, instead use \fBcount $argv\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$!\fP: \fB$last_pid\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$0\fP: \fBstatus filename\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$\-\fP: Mostly \fBstatus is\-interactive\fP and \fBstatus is\-login\fP
.UNINDENT
.SH PROCESS SUBSTITUTION
.sp
Instead of \fB<(command)\fP fish uses \fB(command | psub)\fP\&. There is no equivalent to \fB>(command)\fP\&.
.sp
Note that both of these are bashisms, and most things can easily be expressed without. E.g. instead of:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
source (command | psub)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
just use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
command | source
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
as fish\(aqs source can read from stdin.
.SH HEREDOCS
.sp
Fish does not have \fB<<EOF\fP "heredocs". Instead of:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cat <<EOF
some string
some more string
EOF
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
printf %s\en "some string" "some more string"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo "some string
some more string"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Quotes are followed across newlines.
.SH TEST (TEST, [, [[)
.sp
Fish has a POSIX\-compatible \fBtest\fP or \fB[\fP builtin. There is no \fB[[\fP and \fBtest\fP does not accept \fB==\fP as a synonym for \fB=\fP\&. It can compare floating point numbers, however.
.sp
\fBset \-q\fP can be used to determine if a variable exists or has a certain number of elements (\fBset \-q foo[2]\fP).
.SH ARITHMETIC EXPANSION
.sp
Fish does not have \fB$((i+1))\fP arithmetic expansion, computation is handled by math:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
math $i + 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It can handle floating point numbers:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> math 5 / 2
2.5
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH PROMPTS
.sp
Fish does not use the \fB$PS1\fP, \fB$PS2\fP and so on variables. Instead the prompt is the output of the fish_prompt function, plus the fish_mode_prompt function if vi\-mode is enabled and the fish_right_prompt function for the right prompt.
.sp
As an example, here\(aqs a relatively simple bash prompt:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# <$HOSTNAME> <$PWD in blue> <Prompt Sign in Yellow> <Rest in default light white>
export PS1=\(aq\eh\e[\ee[1;34m\e]\ew\e[\ee[m\e] \e[\ee[1;32m\e]\e$\e[\ee[m\e] \(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and a rough fish equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function fish_prompt
    set \-l prompt_symbol \(aq$\(aq
    fish_is_root_user; and set prompt_symbol \(aq#\(aq

    echo \-s $hostname (set_color blue) (prompt_pwd) \e
    (set_color yellow) $prompt_symbol (set_color normal)
end
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This shows a few differences:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Fish provides set_color to color text. It can use the 16 named colors and also RGB sequences (so you could also use \fBset_color 5555FF\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Instead of introducing specific escapes like \fB\eh\fP for the hostname, the prompt is simply a function, so you can use variables like \fB$hostname\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Fish offers helper functions for adding things to the prompt, like fish_vcs_prompt for adding a display for common version control systems (git, mercurial, svn) and prompt_pwd for showing a shortened $PWD (the user\(aqs home directory becomes \fB~\fP and any path component is shortened).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default prompt is reasonably full\-featured and its code can be read via \fBtype fish_prompt\fP\&.
.sp
Fish does not have \fB$PS2\fP for continuation lines, instead it leaves the lines indented to show that the commandline isn\(aqt complete yet.
.SH BLOCKS AND LOOPS
.sp
Fish\(aqs blocking constructs look a little different. They all start with a word, end in \fBend\fP and don\(aqt have a second starting word:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
for i in 1 2 3; do
   echo $i
done

# becomes

for i in 1 2 3
   echo $i
end

while true; do
   echo Weeee
done

# becomes

while true
   echo Weeeeeee
end

{
   echo Hello
}

# becomes

begin
   echo Hello
end

if true; then
   echo Yes I am true
else
   echo "How is true not true?"
fi

# becomes

if true
   echo Yes I am true
else
   echo "How is true not true?"
end

foo() {
   echo foo
}

# becomes

function foo
    echo foo
end

# (note that bash specifically allows the word "function" as an extension, but POSIX only specifies the form without, so it\(aqs more compatible to just use the form without)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish does not have an \fBuntil\fP\&. Use \fBwhile not\fP or \fBwhile !\fP\&.
.SH SUBSHELLS
.sp
Bash has a feature called "subshells", where it will start another shell process for certain things. That shell will then be independent and e.g. any changes it makes to variables won\(aqt be visible in the main shell.
.sp
This includes things like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# A list of commands in \(ga()\(ga parentheses
(foo; bar) | baz

# Both sides of a pipe
foo | while read \-r bar; do
    # This variable will not be visible outside of the while loop.
    VAR=VAL
    # This background process will not be, either
    baz &
done
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB()\fP subshells are often confused with \fB{}\fP grouping, which does \fInot\fP use a subshell. When you just need to group, you can use \fBbegin; end\fP in fish:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
(foo; bar) | baz
# when it should really have been:
{ foo; bar } | baz
# becomes
begin; foo; bar; end | baz
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The pipe will simply be run in the same process, so \fBwhile read\fP loops can set variables outside:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
foo | while read bar
    set \-g VAR VAL
    baz &
end

echo $VAR # will print VAL
jobs # will show "baz"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Subshells are also frequently confused with \fI\%command substitutions\fP, which bash writes as \fB\(gacommand\(ga\fP or \fB$(command)\fP and fish writes as \fB(command)\fP\&. Bash also \fIuses\fP subshells to implement them.
.sp
The isolation can usually be achieved by just scoping variables (with \fBset \-l\fP), but if you really do need to run your code in a new shell environment you can always use \fBfish \-c \(aqyour code here\(aq\fP to do so explicitly.
.SH BUILTINS AND OTHER COMMANDS
.sp
By now it has become apparent that fish puts much more of a focus on its builtins and external commands rather than its syntax. So here are some helpful builtins and their rough equivalent in bash:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
string \- this replaces most of the string transformation (\fB${i%foo}\fP et al) and can also be used instead of \fBgrep\fP and \fBsed\fP and such.
.IP \(bu 2
math \- this replaces \fB$((i + 1))\fP arithmetic and can also do floats and some simple functions (sine and friends).
.IP \(bu 2
argparse \- this can handle a script\(aqs option parsing, for which bash would probably use \fBgetopt\fP (zsh provides \fBzparseopts\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
count can be used to count things and therefore replaces \fB$#\fP and can be used instead of \fBwc\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
status provides information about the shell status, e.g. if it\(aqs interactive or what the current linenumber is. This replaces \fB$\-\fP and \fB$BASH_LINENO\fP and other variables.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBseq(1)\fP can be used as a replacement for \fB{1..10}\fP range expansion. If your OS doesn\(aqt ship a \fBseq\fP fish includes a replacement function.
