.SH FISH 3.2.0 (RELEASED MARCH 1, 2021)
.SS Notable improvements and fixes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUndo and redo support\fP for the command\-line editor and pager search (\fI\%#1367\fP). By default, undo is bound to Control+Z, and redo to Alt+/.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBuiltins can now output before all data is read\fP\&. For example, \fBstring replace\fP no longer has to read all of stdin before it can begin to output.
This makes it usable also for pipes where the previous command hasn\(aqt finished yet, like:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Show all dmesg lines related to "usb"
dmesg \-w | string match \(aq*usb*\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPrompts will now be truncated\fP instead of replaced with \fB"> "\fP if they are wider than the terminal (\fI\%#904\fP).
For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~/dev/build/fish\-shell\-git/src/fish\-shell/build (makepkg)>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will turn into:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
…h\-shell/build (makepkg)>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is still possible to react to the \fBCOLUMNS\fP variable inside the prompt to implement smarter behavior.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish completes ambiguous completions\fP after pressing \fBTab\fP even when they
have a common prefix, without the user having to press \fBTab\fP again
(\fI\%#6924\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish is less aggressive about resetting terminal modes, such as flow control, after every command.
Although flow control remains off by default, enterprising users can now enable it with
\fBstty\fP (\fI\%#2315\fP, \fI\%#7704\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fB"fish_add_path" helper function to add paths to $PATH\fP without producing duplicates,
to be used interactively or in \fBconfig.fish\fP (\fI\%#6960\fP, \fI\%#7028\fP).
For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fish_add_path /opt/mycoolthing/bin
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will add /opt/mycoolthing/bin to the beginning of $fish_user_path without creating duplicates,
so it can be called safely from config.fish or interactively, and the path will just be there, once.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBetter errors with "test"\fP (\fI\%#6030\fP):
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> test 1 = 2 and echo true or false
test: Expected a combining operator like \(aq\-a\(aq at index 4
1 = 2 and echo true or echo false
      ^
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This includes numbering the index from 1 instead of 0, like fish lists.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA new theme for the documentation and Web\-based configuration\fP (\fI\%#6500\fP, \fI\%#7371\fP, \fI\%#7523\fP), matching the design on fishshell.com.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish \-\-no\-execute\fP \fBwill no longer complain about unknown commands\fP
or non\-matching wildcards, as these could be defined differently at
runtime (especially for functions). This makes it usable as a static syntax checker (\fI\%#977\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring match \-\-regex\fP now integrates \fBnamed PCRE2 capture groups as fish variables\fP, allowing variables to be set directly from \fBstring match\fP (\fI\%#7459\fP). To support this functionality, \fBstring\fP is now a reserved word and can no longer be wrapped in a function.
.IP \(bu 2
Globs and other \fBexpansions are limited to 512,288 results\fP (\fI\%#7226\fP). Because operating systems limit the number of arguments to commands, larger values are unlikely to work anyway, and this helps to avoid hangs.
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fB"fish for bash users" documentation page\fP gives a quick overview of the scripting differences between bash and fish (\fI\%#2382\fP), and the completion tutorial has also been moved out into its own document (\fI\%#6709\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS Syntax changes and new commands
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Range limits in index range expansions like \fB$x[$start..$end]\fP may be omitted: \fB$start\fP and \fB$end\fP default to 1 and \-1 (the last item) respectively (\fI\%#6574\fP):
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo $var[1..]
echo $var[..\-1]
echo $var[..]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All print the full list \fB$var\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
When globbing, a segment which is exactly \fB**\fP may now match zero directories. For example \fB**/foo\fP may match \fBfoo\fP in the current directory (\fI\%#7222\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS Scripting improvements
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBtype\fP, \fB_\fP (gettext), \fB\&.\fP (source) and \fB:\fP (no\-op) functions
are now implemented builtins for performance purposes (\fI\%#7342\fP, \fI\%#7036\fP, \fI\%#6854\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset\fP and backgrounded jobs no longer overwrite \fB$pipestatus\fP (\fI\%#6820\fP), improving its use in command substitutions (\fI\%#6998\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Computed ("electric") variables such as \fBstatus\fP are now only global in scope, so \fBset \-Uq status\fP returns false (\fI\%#7032\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The output for \fBset \-\-show\fP has been shortened, only mentioning the scopes in which a variable exists (\fI\%#6944\fP).
In addition, it now shows if a variable is a path variable.
.IP \(bu 2
A new variable, \fBfish_kill_signal\fP, is set to the signal that terminated the last foreground job, or \fB0\fP if the job exited normally (\fI\%#6824\fP, \fI\%#6822\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new subcommand, \fBstring pad\fP, allows extending strings to a given width (\fI\%#7340\fP, \fI\%#7102\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring sub\fP has a new \fB\-\-end\fP option to specify the end index of
a substring (\fI\%#6765\fP, \fI\%#5974\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring split\fP has a new \fB\-\-fields\fP option to specify fields to
output, similar to \fBcut \-f\fP (\fI\%#6770\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring trim\fP now also trims vertical tabs by default (\fI\%#6795\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring replace\fP no longer prints an error if a capturing group wasn\(aqt matched, instead treating it as empty (\fI\%#7343\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP subcommands now quit early when used with \fB\-\-quiet\fP (\fI\%#7495\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring repeat\fP now handles multiple arguments, repeating each one (\fI\%#5988\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBprintf\fP no longer prints an error if not given an argument (not
even a format string).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBtrue\fP and \fBfalse\fP builtins ignore any arguments, like other shells (\fI\%#7030\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent\fP now removes unnecessary quotes in simple cases (\fI\%#6722\fP)
and gained a \fB\-\-check\fP option to just check if a file is indented correctly (\fI\%#7251\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent\fP indents continuation lines that follow a line ending in a backslash, \fB|\fP, \fB&&\fP or \fB||\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpushd\fP only adds a directory to the stack if changing to it was successful (\fI\%#6947\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBfish_job_summary\fP function is called whenever a
background job stops or ends, or any job terminates from a signal (\fI\%#6959\fP, \fI\%#2727\fP, \fI\%#4319\fP).
The default behaviour can now be customized by redefining it.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstatus\fP gained new \fBdirname\fP and \fBbasename\fP convenience subcommands
to get just the directory to the running script or the name of it,
to simplify common tasks such as running \fB(dirname (status filename))\fP (\fI\%#7076\fP, \fI\%#1818\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Broken pipelines are now handled more smoothly; in particular, bad redirection mid\-pipeline
results in the job continuing to run but with the broken file descriptor replaced with a closed
file descriptor. This allows better error recovery and is more in line with other shells\(aq
behaviour (\fI\%#7038\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBjobs \-\-quiet PID\fP no longer prints "no suitable job" if the job for PID does not exist (eg\ because it has finished) (\fI\%#6809\fP, \fI\%#6812\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBjobs\fP now shows continued child processes correctly (\fI\%#6818\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdisown\fP should no longer create zombie processes when job control is off, such as in \fBconfig.fish\fP (\fI\%#7183\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcommand\fP, \fBjobs\fP and \fBtype\fP builtins support \fB\-\-query\fP as the long form of \fB\-q\fP, matching other builtins.
The long form \fB\-\-quiet\fP is deprecated (\fI\%#7276\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP no longer requires a short flag letter for long\-only options (\fI\%#7585\fP)
and only prints a backtrace with invalid options to argparse itself (\fI\%#6703\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now passes the validation variables (e.g. \fB$_flag_value\fP) as local\-exported variables,
avoiding the need for \fB\-\-no\-scope\-shadowing\fP in validation functions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete\fP takes the first argument as the name of the command if the \fB\-\-command\fP/\fB\-c\fP option is not used,
so \fBcomplete git\fP is treated like \fBcomplete \-\-command git\fP,
and it can show the loaded completions for specific commands with \fBcomplete COMMANDNAME\fP (\fI\%#7321\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset_color \-b\fP (without an argument) no longer prints an error message, matching other invalid invocations of this command (\fI\%#7154\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexec\fP no longer produces a syntax error when the command cannot be found (\fI\%#6098\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset \-\-erase\fP and \fBabbr \-\-erase\fP can now erase multiple things in one go, matching \fBfunctions \-\-erase\fP (\fI\%#7377\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBabbr \-\-erase\fP no longer prints errors when used with no arguments or on an unset abbreviation (\fI\%#7376\fP, \fI\%#7732\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtest \-t\fP, for testing whether file descriptors are connected to a terminal, works for file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 (\fI\%#4766\fP).
It can still return incorrect results in other cases (\fI\%#1228\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Trying to execute scripts with Windows line endings (CRLF) produces a sensible error (\fI\%#2783\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Trying to execute commands with arguments that exceed the operating system limit now produces a specific error (\fI\%#6800\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
An \fBalias\fP that delegates to a command with the same name no longer triggers an error about recursive completion (\fI\%#7389\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP now has a \fB\-\-base\fP option to output the result in hexadecimal or octal (\fI\%#7496\fP) and produces more specific error messages (\fI\%#7508\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP learned bitwise functions \fBbitand\fP, \fBbitor\fP and \fBbitxor\fP, used like \fBmath "bitand(0xFE, 5)"\fP (\fI\%#7281\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP learned tau for those who don\(aqt like typing "2 * pi".
.IP \(bu 2
Failed redirections will now set \fB$status\fP (\fI\%#7540\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish sets exit status in a more consistent manner after errors, including invalid expansions like \fB$foo[\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Using \fBread \-\-silent\fP while fish is in private mode was adding these potentially\-sensitive entries to the history; this has been fixed (\fI\%#7230\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP can now read interactively from other files, and can be used to read from the terminal via \fBread </dev/tty\fP (if the operating system provides \fB/dev/tty\fP) (\fI\%#7358\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBfish_status_to_signal\fP function for transforming exit statuses to signal names has been added (\fI\%#7597\fP, \fI\%#7595\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fallback \fBrealpath\fP builtin supports the \fB\-s\fP/\fB\-\-no\-symlinks\fP option, like GNU realpath (\fI\%#7574\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions\fP and \fBtype\fP now explain when a function was defined via \fBsource\fP instead of just saying \fBDefined in \-\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Significant performance improvements when globbing, appending to variables or in \fBmath\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBecho\fP no longer interprets options at the beginning of an argument (eg \fBecho "\-n foo"\fP) (\fI\%#7614\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish now finds user configuration even if the \fBHOME\fP environment variable is not set (\fI\%#7620\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer crashes when started from a Windows\-style working directory (eg \fBF:\epath\fP) (\fI\%#7636\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish \-c\fP now reads the remaining arguments into \fB$argv\fP (\fI\%#2314\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBpwd\fP command supports the long options \fB\-\-logical\fP and \fB\-\-physical\fP, matching other implementations (\fI\%#6787\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish \-\-profile\fP now only starts profiling after fish is ready to execute commands (all configuration is completed). There is a new \fB\-\-profile\-startup\fP option that only profiles the startup and configuration process (\fI\%#7648\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Builtins return a maximum exit status of 255, rather than potentially overflowing. In particular, this affects \fBexit\fP, \fBreturn\fP, \fBfunctions \-\-query\fP, and \fBset \-\-query\fP (\fI\%#7698\fP, \fI\%#7702\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
It is no longer an error to run builtin with closed stdin. For example \fBcount <&\-\fP now prints 0, instead of failing.
.IP \(bu 2
Blocks, functions, and builtins no longer permit redirecting to file descriptors other than 0 (standard input), 1 (standard output) and 2 (standard error). For example, \fBecho hello >&5\fP is now an error. This prevents corruption of internal state (#3303).
.UNINDENT
.SS Interactive improvements
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
fish will now always attempt to become process group leader in interactive mode (\fI\%#7060\fP). This helps avoid hangs in certain circumstances, and allows tmux\(aqs current directory introspection to work (\fI\%#5699\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The interactive reader now allows ending a line in a logical operators (\fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP) instead of complaining about a missing command. (This was already syntactically valid, but interactive sessions didn\(aqt know about it yet).
.IP \(bu 2
The prompt is reprinted after a background job exits (\fI\%#1018\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer inserts a space after a completion ending in \fB\&.\fP, \fB,\fP or \fB\-\fP is accepted, improving completions for tools that provide dynamic completions (\fI\%#6928\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
If a filename is invalid when first pressing \fBTab\fP, but becomes valid, it will be completed properly on the next attempt (\fI\%#6863\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp string match/replace/<subcommand>\fP will show the help for string subcommands (\fI\%#6786\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_key_reader\fP sets the exit status to 0 when used with \fB\-\-help\fP or \fB\-\-version\fP (\fI\%#6964\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_key_reader\fP and \fBfish_indent\fP send output from \fB\-\-version\fP to standard output, matching other fish binaries (\fI\%#6964\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new variable \fB$status_generation\fP is incremented only when the previous command produces an exit status (\fI\%#6815\fP). This can be used, for example, to check whether a failure status is a holdover due to a background job, or actually produced by the last run command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_greeting\fP is now a function that reads a variable of the same name, and defaults to setting it globally.
This removes a universal variable by default and helps with updating the greeting.
However, to disable the greeting it is now necessary to explicitly specify universal scope (\fBset \-U fish_greeting\fP) or to disable it in config.fish (\fI\%#7265\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Events are properly emitted after a job is cancelled (\fI\%#2356\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_preexec\fP and \fBfish_postexec\fP events are no longer triggered for empty commands (\fI\%#4829\fP, \fI\%#7085\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Functions triggered by the \fBfish_exit\fP event are correctly run when the terminal is closed or the shell receives SIGHUP (\fI\%#7014\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_prompt\fP event no longer fires when \fBread\fP is used. If
you need a function to run any time \fBread\fP is invoked by a script,
use the new \fBfish_read\fP event instead (\fI\%#7039\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBfish_posterror\fP event is emitted when attempting to execute a command with syntax errors (\fI\%#6880\fP, \fI\%#6816\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The debugging system has now fully switched from the old numbered level to the new named category system introduced in 3.1. A number of new debugging categories have been added, including \fBconfig\fP, \fBpath\fP, \fBreader\fP and \fBscreen\fP (\fI\%#6511\fP). See the output of \fBfish \-\-print\-debug\-categories\fP for the full list.
.IP \(bu 2
The warning about read\-only filesystems has been moved to a new "warning\-path" debug category
and can be disabled by setting a debug category of \fB\-warning\-path\fP (\fI\%#6630\fP):
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fish \-\-debug=\-warning\-path
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
The enabled debug categories are now printed on shell startup (\fI\%#7007\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\-o\fP short option to fish, for \fB\-\-debug\-output\fP, works correctly instead of producing an
invalid option error (\fI\%#7254\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish\(aqs debugging can now also be enabled via \fBFISH_DEBUG\fP and \fBFISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT\fP environment variables.
This helps with debugging when no commandline options can be passed, like when fish is called in a shebang (\fI\%#7359\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Abbreviations are now expanded after all command terminators (eg \fB;\fP or \fB|\fP), not just space,
as in fish 2.7.1 and before (\fI\%#6970\fP), and after closing a command substitution (\fI\%#6658\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The history file is now created with user\-private permissions,
matching other shells (\fI\%#6926\fP). The directory containing the history
file was already private, so there should not have been any private data
revealed.
.IP \(bu 2
The output of \fBtime\fP is now properly aligned in all cases (\fI\%#6726\fP, \fI\%#6714\fP) and no longer depends on locale (\fI\%#6757\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The command\-not\-found handling has been simplified.
When it can\(aqt find a command, fish now just executes a function called \fBfish_command_not_found\fP
instead of firing an event, making it easier to replace and reason about.
Previously\-defined \fB__fish_command_not_found_handler\fP functions with an appropriate event listener will still work (\fI\%#7293\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBControl\-C\fP handling has been reimplemented in C++ and is therefore quicker (\fI\%#5259\fP), no longer occasionally prints an "unknown command" error (\fI\%#7145\fP) or overwrites multiline prompts (\fI\%#3537\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBControl\-C\fP no longer kills background jobs for which job control is
disabled, matching POSIX semantics (\fI\%#6828\fP, \fI\%#6861\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Autosuggestions work properly after \fBControl\-C\fP cancels the current commmand line (\fI\%#6937\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
History search is now case\-insensitive unless the search string contains an uppercase character (\fI\%#7273\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_update_completions\fP gained a new \fB\-\-keep\fP option, which improves speed by skipping completions that already exist (\fI\%#6775\fP, \fI\%#6796\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Aliases containing an embedded backslash appear properly in the output of \fBalias\fP (\fI\%#6910\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBopen\fP no longer hangs indefinitely on certain systems, as a bug in \fBxdg\-open\fP has been worked around (\fI\%#7215\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Long command lines no longer add a blank line after execution (\fI\%#6826\fP) and behave better with \fBBackspace\fP (\fI\%#6951\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions \-t\fP works like the long option \fB\-\-handlers\-type\fP, as documented, instead of producing an error (\fI\%#6985\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
History search now flashes when it found no more results (\fI\%#7362\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
fish now creates the path in the environment variable \fBXDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fP if it does not exist, before using it for runtime data storage (\fI\%#7335\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset_color \-\-print\-colors\fP now also respects the bold, dim, underline, reverse, italic and background modifiers, to better show their effect (\fI\%#7314\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fish Web configuration tool (\fBfish_config\fP) shows prompts correctly on Termux for Android (\fI\%#7298\fP) and detects Windows Services for Linux 2 properly (\fI\%#7027\fP). It no longer shows the \fBhistory\fP variable as it may be too large (one can use the History tab instead). It also starts the browser in another thread, avoiding hangs in some circumstances, especially with Firefox\(aqs Developer Edition (\fI\%#7158\fP). Finally, a bug in the Source Code Pro font may cause browsers to hang, so this font is no longer chosen by default (\fI\%#7714\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfuncsave\fP gained a new \fB\-\-directory\fP option to specify the location of the saved function (\fI\%#7041\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp\fP works properly on MSYS2 (\fI\%#7113\fP) and only uses \fBcmd.exe\fP if running on WSL (\fI\%#6797\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Resuming a piped job by its number, like \fBfg %1\fP, works correctly (\fI\%#7406\fP). Resumed jobs show the correct title in the terminal emulator (\fI\%#7444\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Commands run from key bindings now use the same TTY modes as normal commands (\fI\%#7483\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Autosuggestions from history are now case\-sensitive (\fI\%#3978\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$status\fP from completion scripts is no longer passed outside the completion, which keeps the status display in the prompt as the last command\(aqs status (\fI\%#7555\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Updated localisations for pt_BR (\fI\%#7480\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_trace\fP output now starts with \fB\->\fP (like \fBfish \-\-profile\fP), making the depth more visible (\fI\%#7538\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Resizing the terminal window no longer produces a corrupted prompt (\fI\%#6532\fP, \fI\%#7404\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions\fP produces an error rather than crashing on certain invalid arguments (\fI\%#7515\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A crash in completions with inline variable assignment (eg \fBA= b\fP) has been fixed (\fI\%#7344\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_private_mode\fP may now be changed dynamically using \fBset\fP (\fI\%#7589\fP), and history is kept in memory in private mode (but not stored permanently) (\fI\%#7590\fP).
.IP \(bu 2

and before (\fI\%#6650\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Functions using \fB\-\-on\-job\-exit\fP and \fB\-\-on\-process\-exit\fP work
reliably again (\fI\%#6679\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Functions using \fB\-\-on\-signal INT\fP work reliably in interactive
sessions, as they did in fish 2.7 and before (\fI\%#6649\fP). These handlers
have never worked in non\-interactive sessions, and making them work
is an ongoing process.
.IP \(bu 2
Functions using \fB\-\-on\-variable\fP work reliably with variables which
are set implicitly (rather than with \fBset\fP), such as
“\fBfish_bind_mode\fP” and “\fBPWD\fP” (\fI\%#6653\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were
incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 (\fB$TERM\fP begins with xterm, does
not include “\fB256color\fP”, and \fB$TERM_PROGRAM\fP is not set)
(\fI\%#6701\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The Mercurial (\fBhg\fP) prompt no longer produces an error when the
current working directory is removed (\fI\%#6699\fP). Also, for performance
reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the
detailed status, set \fB$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The VCS prompt, \fBfish_vcs_prompt\fP, no longer displays Subversion
(\fBsvn\fP) status by default, due to the potential slowness of this
operation (\fI\%#6681\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Pasting of commands has been sped up (\fI\%#6713\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non\-Unicode
capable locale (such as the \fBC\fP or \fBPOSIX\fP locale) no longer
renders all output blank (\fI\%#6736\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp\fP prefers to use \fBxdg\-open\fP, avoiding the use of \fBopen\fP on
Debian systems where this command is actually \fBopenvt\fP (\fI\%#6739\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history,
now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight
Commander integration (\fI\%#6763\fP), but may be changed in a future
version.
.IP \(bu 2
Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of
the content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (\fI\%#6927\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfzf\fP in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as
part of command substitutions or \fBeval\fP will no longer have
separate process groups. (\fI\%#6624\fP, \fI\%#6806\fP).

.SS Errata for fish 3.1
.sp
A new builtin, \fBtime\fP, was introduced in the fish 3.1 releases. This
builtin is a reserved word (like \fBtest\fP, \fBfunction\fP, and others)
because of the way it is implemented, and functions can no longer be
named \fBtime\fP\&. This was not clear in the fish 3.1b1 changelog.

.SH FISH 3.1B1 (RELEASED JANUARY 26, 2020)
.SS Notable improvements and fixes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fB$pipestatus\fP variable contains a list of exit statuses of
the previous job, for each of the separate commands in a pipeline
(\fI\%#5632\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer buffers pipes to the last function in a pipeline,
improving many cases where pipes appeared to block or hang (\fI\%#1396\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
An overhaul of error messages for builtin commands, including a
removal of the overwhelming usage summary, more readable stack traces
(\fI\%#3404\fP, \fI\%#5434\fP), and stack traces for \fBtest\fP (aka \fB[\fP) (\fI\%#5771\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish’s debugging arguments have been significantly improved. The
\fB\-\-debug\-level\fP option has been removed, and a new \fB\-\-debug\fP
option replaces it. This option accepts various categories, which may
be listed via \fBfish \-\-print\-debug\-categories\fP (\fI\%#5879\fP). A new
\fB\-\-debug\-output\fP option allows for redirection of debug output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP has a new \fBcollect\fP subcommand for use in command
substitutions, producing a single output instead of splitting on new
lines (similar to \fB"$(cmd)"\fP in other shells) (\fI\%#159\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fish manual, tutorial and FAQ are now available in \fBman\fP format
as \fBfish\-doc\fP, \fBfish\-tutorial\fP and \fBfish\-faq\fP respectively
(\fI\%#5521\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Like other shells, \fBcd\fP now always looks for its argument in the
current directory as a last resort, even if the \fBCDPATH\fP variable
does not include it or “.” (\fI\%#4484\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish now correctly handles \fBCDPATH\fP entries that start with \fB\&..\fP
(\fI\%#6220\fP) or contain \fB\&./\fP (\fI\%#5887\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_trace\fP variable may be set to trace execution (\fI\%#3427\fP).
This performs a similar role as \fBset \-x\fP in other shells.
.IP \(bu 2
fish uses the temporary directory determined by the system, rather
than relying on \fB/tmp\fP (\fI\%#3845\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fish Web configuration tool (\fBfish_config\fP) prints a list of
commands it is executing, to help understanding and debugging
(\fI\%#5584\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Major performance improvements when pasting (\fI\%#5866\fP), executing lots
of commands (\fI\%#5905\fP), importing history from bash (\fI\%#6295\fP), and when
completing variables that might match \fB$history\fP (\fI\%#6288\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS Syntax changes and new commands
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new builtin command, \fBtime\fP, which allows timing of fish
functions and builtins as well as external commands (\fI\%#117\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a “,” or a
variable expansion, meaning common commands such as
\fBgit reset HEAD@{0}\fP do not require escaping (\fI\%#5869\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
New redirections \fB&>\fP and \fB&|\fP may be used to redirect or pipe
stdout, and also redirect stderr to stdout (\fI\%#6192\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBswitch\fP now allows arguments that expand to nothing, like empty
variables (\fI\%#5677\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBVAR=val cmd\fP syntax can now be used to run a command in a
modified environment (\fI\%#6287\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBand\fP is no longer recognised as a command, so that nonsensical
constructs like \fBand and and\fP produce a syntax error (\fI\%#6089\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP‘s exponent operator,’\fB^\fP‘, was previously
left\-associative, but now uses the more commonly\-used
right\-associative behaviour (\fI\%#6280\fP). This means that
\fBmath \(aq3^0.5^2\(aq\fP was previously calculated as’(3\s-2\u0.5)\d\s02’,
but is now calculated as ‘3\s-2\u(0.5\d\s02)’.
.IP \(bu 2
In fish 3.0, the variable used with \fBfor\fP loops inside command
substitutions could leak into enclosing scopes; this was an
inadvertent behaviour change and has been reverted (\fI\%#6480\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS Scripting improvements
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring split0\fP now returns 0 if it split something (\fI\%#5701\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
In the interest of consistency, \fBbuiltin \-q\fP and \fBcommand \-q\fP can
now be used to query if a builtin or command exists (\fI\%#5631\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP now accepts \fB\-\-scale=max\fP for the maximum scale (\fI\%#5579\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbuiltin $var\fP now works correctly, allowing a variable as the
builtin name (\fI\%#5639\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcd\fP understands the \fB\-\-\fP argument to make it possible to change
to directories starting with a hyphen (\fI\%#6071\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete \-\-do\-complete\fP now also does fuzzy matches (\fI\%#5467\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete \-\-do\-complete\fP can be used inside completions, allowing
limited recursion (\fI\%#3474\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcount\fP now also counts lines fed on standard input (\fI\%#5744\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBeval\fP produces an exit status of 0 when given no arguments, like
other shells (\fI\%#5692\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBprintf\fP prints what it can when input hasn’t been fully converted
to a number, but still prints an error (\fI\%#5532\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete \-C foo\fP now works as expected, rather than requiring
\fBcomplete \-Cfoo\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete\fP has a new \fB\-\-force\-files\fP option, to re\-enable file
completions. This allows \fBsudo \-E\fP and \fBpacman \-Qo\fP to complete
correctly (\fI\%#5646\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now defaults to showing the current function name
(instead of \fBargparse\fP) in its errors, making \fB\-\-name\fP often
superfluous (\fI\%#5835\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP has a new \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\fP option to keep
unrecognized options, allowing multiple argparse passes to parse
options (\fI\%#5367\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP correctly handles flag value validation of options that
only have short names (\fI\%#5864\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread \-S\fP (short option of \fB\-\-shell\fP) is recognised correctly
(\fI\%#5660\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP understands \fB\-\-list\fP, which acts like \fB\-\-array\fP in
reading all arguments into a list inside a single variable, but is
better named (\fI\%#5846\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP has a new option, \fB\-\-tokenize\fP, which splits a string into
variables according to the shell’s tokenization rules, considering
quoting, escaping, and so on (\fI\%#3823\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP interacts more correctly with the deprecated \fB$IFS\fP
variable, in particular removing multiple separators when splitting a
variable into a list (\fI\%#6406\fP), matching other shells.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent\fP now handles semicolons better, including leaving them
in place for \fB; and\fP and \fB; or\fP instead of breaking the line
(\fI\%#5859\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent \-\-write\fP now supports multiple file arguments,
indenting them in turn.
.IP \(bu 2
The default read limit has been increased to 100MiB (\fI\%#5267\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP now also understands \fBx\fP for multiplication, provided it
is followed by whitespace (\fI\%#5906\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP reports the right error when incorrect syntax is used inside
parentheses (\fI\%#6063\fP), and warns when unsupported logical operations
are used (\fI\%#6096\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions \-\-erase\fP now also prevents fish from autoloading a
function for the first time (\fI\%#5951\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBjobs \-\-last\fP returns 0 to indicate success when a job is found
(\fI\%#6104\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcommandline \-p\fP and \fBcommandline \-j\fP now split on \fB&&\fP and
\fB||\fP in addition to \fB;\fP and \fB&\fP (\fI\%#6214\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where \fBstring split\fP would drop empty strings if the output
was only empty strings has been fixed (\fI\%#5987\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBeval\fP no long creates a new local variable scope, but affects
variables in the scope it is called from (\fI\%#4443\fP). \fBsource\fP still
creates a new local scope.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBabbr\fP has a new \fB\-\-query\fP option to check for the existence of
an abbreviation.
.IP \(bu 2
Local values for \fBfish_complete_path\fP and \fBfish_function_path\fP
are now ignored; only their global values are respected.
.IP \(bu 2
Syntax error reports now display a marker in the correct position
(\fI\%#5812\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Empty universal variables may now be exported (\fI\%#5992\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Exported universal variables are no longer imported into the global
scope, preventing shadowing. This makes it easier to change such
variables for all fish sessions and avoids breakage when the value is
a list of multiple elements (\fI\%#5258\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where \fBfor\fP could use invalid variable names has been fixed
(\fI\%#5800\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where local variables would not be exported to functions has
been fixed (\fI\%#6153\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The null command (\fB:\fP) now always exits successfully, rather than
passing through the previous exit status (\fI\%#6022\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The output of \fBfunctions FUNCTION\fP matches the declaration of the
function, correctly including comments or blank lines (\fI\%#5285\fP), and
correctly includes any \fB\-\-wraps\fP flags (\fI\%#1625\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtype\fP supports a new option, \fB\-\-short\fP, which suppress function
expansion (\fI\%#6403\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtype \-\-path\fP with a function argument will now output the path to
the file containing the definition of that function, if it exists.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtype \-\-force\-path\fP with an argument that cannot be found now
correctly outputs nothing, as documented (\fI\%#6411\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB$hostname\fP variable is no longer truncated to 32 characters
(\fI\%#5758\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Line numbers in function backtraces are calculated correctly (\fI\%#6350\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBfish_cancel\fP event is emitted when the command line is
cancelled, which is useful for terminal integration (\fI\%#5973\fP).

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
New Base16 color options are available through the Web\-based
configuration (\fI\%#6504\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish only parses \fB/etc/paths\fP on macOS in login shells, matching
the bash implementation (\fI\%#5637\fP) and avoiding changes to path ordering
in child shells (\fI\%#5456\fP). It now ignores blank lines like the bash
implementation (\fI\%#5809\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The locale is now reloaded when the \fBLOCPATH\fP variable is changed
(\fI\%#5815\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP no longer keeps a history, making it suitable for operations
that shouldn’t end up there, like password entry (\fI\%#5904\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdirh\fP outputs its stack in the correct order (\fI\%#5477\fP), and behaves
as documented when universal variables are used for its stack
(\fI\%#5797\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunced\fP and the edit\-commandline\-in\-buffer bindings did not work
in fish 3.0 when the \fB$EDITOR\fP variable contained spaces; this has
been corrected (\fI\%#5625\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Builtins now pipe their help output to a pager automatically (\fI\%#6227\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset_color\fP now colors the \fB\-\-print\-colors\fP output in the
matching colors if it is going to a terminal.
.IP \(bu 2
fish now underlines every valid entered path instead of just the last
one (\fI\%#5872\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
When syntax highlighting a string with an unclosed quote, only the
quote itself will be shown as an error, instead of the whole
argument.
.IP \(bu 2
Syntax highlighting works correctly with variables as commands
(\fI\%#5658\fP) and redirections to close file descriptors (\fI\%#6092\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp\fP works properly on Windows Subsytem for Linux (\fI\%#5759\fP, \fI\%#6338\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where \fBdisown\fP could crash the shell has been fixed (\fI\%#5720\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish will not autosuggest files ending with \fB~\fP unless there are no
other candidates, as these are generally backup files (\fI\%#985\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Escape in the pager works correctly (\fI\%#5818\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Key bindings that call \fBfg\fP no longer leave the terminal in a
broken state (\fI\%#2114\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Brackets (\fI\%#5831\fP) and filenames containing \fB$\fP (\fI\%#6060\fP) are completed
with appropriate escaping.
.IP \(bu 2
The output of \fBcomplete\fP and \fBfunctions\fP is now colorized in
interactive terminals.
.IP \(bu 2
The Web\-based configuration handles aliases that include single
quotes correctly (\fI\%#6120\fP), and launches correctly under Termux (\fI\%#6248\fP)
and OpenBSD (\fI\%#6522\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunction\fP now correctly validates parameters for
\fB\-\-argument\-names\fP as valid variable names (\fI\%#6147\fP) and correctly
parses options following \fB\-\-argument\-names\fP, as in
“\fB\-\-argument\-names foo \-\-description bar\fP” (\fI\%#6186\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
History newly imported from bash includes command lines using \fB&&\fP
or \fB||\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The automatic generation of completions from manual pages is better
described in job and process listings, and no longer produces a
warning when exiting fish (\fI\%#6269\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
In private mode, setting \fB$fish_greeting\fP to an empty string before
starting the private session will prevent the warning about history
not being saved from being printed (\fI\%#6299\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
In the interactive editor, a line break (Enter) inside unclosed
brackets will insert a new line, rather than executing the command
and producing an error (\fI\%#6316\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Ctrl\-C always repaints the prompt (\fI\%#6394\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
When run interactively from another program (such as Python), fish
will correctly start a new process group, like other shells (\fI\%#5909\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Job identifiers (for example, for background jobs) are assigned more
logically (\fI\%#6053\fP).

forwards by one bigword (words separated by whitespace) (\fI\%#1505\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The default escape delay (to differentiate between the escape key and
an alt\-combination) has been reduced to 30ms, down from 300ms for the
default mode and 100ms for Vi mode (\fI\%#3904\fP).
.IP \(bu 2

The \fBfish_clipboard_*\fP functions support Wayland by using
\fI\%wl\-clipboard\fP
(\fI\%#5450\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBnextd\fP and \fBprevd\fP functions no longer print “Hit end of
history”, instead using a bell. They correctly store working
directories containing symbolic links (\fI\%#6395\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
If a \fBfish_mode_prompt\fP function exists, Vi mode will only execute
it on mode\-switch instead of the entire prompt. This should make it
much more responsive with slow prompts (\fI\%#5783\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The path\-component bindings (like Ctrl\-w) now also stop at “:” and
“@”, because those are used to denote user and host in commands such
as \fBssh\fP (\fI\%#5841\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The NULL character can now be bound via \fBbind \-k nul\fP\&. Terminals
often generate this character via control\-space. (\fI\%#3189\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new readline command \fBexpand\-abbr\fP can be used to trigger
abbreviation expansion (\fI\%#5762\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new readline command, \fBdelete\-or\-exit\fP, removes a character to
the right of the cursor or exits the shell if the command line is
empty (moving this functionality out of the \fBdelete\-or\-exit\fP
function).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBself\-insert\fP readline command will now insert the binding
sequence, if not empty.
.IP \(bu 2
A new binding to prepend \fBsudo\fP, bound to Alt\-S by default (\fI\%#6140\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The Alt\-W binding to describe a command should now work better with
multiline prompts (\fI\%#6110\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
The Alt\-H binding to open a command’s man page now tries to ignore
\fBsudo\fP (\fI\%#6122\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new pair of bind functions, \fBhistory\-prefix\-search\-backward\fP (and
\fBforward\fP), was introduced (\fI\%#6143\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Vi mode now supports R to enter replace mode (\fI\%#6342\fP), and \fBd0\fP to
delete the current line (\fI\%#6292\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
In Vi mode, hitting Enter in replace\-one mode no longer erases the

The vcs\-prompt functions have been promoted to names without

__fish_vcs_prompt is now fish_vcs_prompt, __fish_hg_prompt is now
fish_hg_prompt and __fish_svn_prompt is now fish_svn_prompt. Shims
at the old names have been added, and the variables have kept their
old names (\fI\%#5586\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring replace\fP has an additional round of escaping in the
replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes
(eg \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e\e\e\e$1\(aq a\fP). The new feature
flag \fBregex\-easyesc\fP can be used to disable this, so that the same
effect can be achieved with
\fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e$1\(aq a\fP (\fI\%#5556\fP). As a reminder,
the intention behind feature flags is that this will eventually
become the default and then only option, so scripts should be
updated.

mandoc can now be used to format the output from \fB\-\-help\fP if

Completions for \fBnpm\fP, \fBbower\fP and \fByarn\fP no longer require the
\fBjq\fP utility for full functionality, but will use Python instead if
it is available.

The paths for completions, functions and configuration snippets have
been extended. On systems that define \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fP, each of the
directories in this variable are searched in the subdirectories
\fBfish/vendor_completions.d\fP, \fBfish/vendor_functions.d\fP, and
\fBfish/vendor_conf.d\fP respectively. On systems that do not define
this variable in the environment, the vendor directories are searched

the current shell. Additionally, job management commands (\fBdisown\fP,
\fBwait\fP, \fBbg\fP, \fBfg\fP and \fBkill\fP) will expand job specifiers
starting with \fB%\fP (\fI\%#4230\fP, \fI\%#1202\fP).

\fBset x[1] x[2] a b\fP, to set multiple elements of an array at once,
is no longer valid syntax (\fI\%#4236\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A literal \fB{}\fP now expands to itself, rather than nothing. This
makes working with \fBfind \-exec\fP easier (\fI\%#1109\fP, \fI\%#4632\fP).

Literally accessing a zero\-index is now illegal syntax and is caught
by the parser (\fI\%#4862\fP). (fish indices start at 1)

Successive commas in brace expansions are handled in less surprising
manner. For example, \fB{,,,}\fP expands to four empty strings rather

.SH FISH 2.5B1 (RELEASED JANUARY 14, 2017)
.SS Platform Changes
.sp
Starting with version 2.5, fish requires a more up\-to\-date version of
C++, specifically C++11 (from 2011). This affects some older platforms:
.SS Linux
.sp
For users building from source, GCC’s g++ 4.8 or later, or LLVM’s clang
3.3 or later, are known to work. Older platforms may require a newer
compiler installed.
.sp
Unfortunately, because of the complexity of the toolchain, binary
packages are no longer published by the fish\-shell developers for the
following platforms:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 5 & 6 for 64\-bit builds
.IP \(bu 2
Ubuntu 12.04 (EoLTS April 2017)
.IP \(bu 2
Debian 7 (EoLTS May 2018)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Installing newer version of fish on these systems will require building
from source.
.SS OS X SnowLeopard
.sp
Starting with version 2.5, fish requires a C++11 standard library on OS
X 10.6 (“SnowLeopard”). If this library is not installed, you will see
this error: \fBdyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib\fP
.sp
MacPorts is the easiest way to obtain this library. After installing the
SnowLeopard MacPorts release from the install page, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo port \-v install libcxx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now fish should launch successfully. (Please open an issue if it does
not.)
.sp
This is only necessary on 10.6. OS X 10.7 and later include the required
library by default.

.IP \(bu 2
Attempting to exit with running processes in the background produces
a warning, then signals them to terminate if a second attempt to exit
is made. This brings the behaviour for running background processes
into line with stopped processes. (\fI\%#3497\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrandom\fP can now have start, stop and step values specified, or the
new \fBchoice\fP subcommand can be used to pick an argument from a list
(\fI\%#3619\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new key bindings preset, \fBfish_hybrid_key_bindings\fP, including
all the Emacs\-style and Vi\-style bindings, which behaves like
\fBfish_vi_key_bindings\fP in fish 2.3.0 (\fI\%#3556\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunction\fP now returns an error when called with invalid options,
rather than defining the function anyway (\fI\%#3574\fP). This was a

fish no longer prints a warning when it identifies a running instance
of an old version (2.1.0 and earlier). Changes to universal variables

.SH FISH 2.1.2 (RELEASED FEB 24, 2015)
.sp
fish 2.1.2 contains a workaround for a filesystem bug in Mac OS X
Yosemite. \fI\%#1859\fP
.sp
Specifically, after installing fish 2.1.1 and then rebooting, “Verify
Disk” in Disk Utility will report “Invalid number of hard links.” We
don’t have any reports of data loss or other adverse consequences. fish
2.1.2 avoids triggering the bug, but does not repair an already affected
filesystem. To repair the filesystem, you can boot into Recovery Mode
and use Repair Disk from Disk Utility. Linux and versions of OS X prior
to Yosemite are believed to be unaffected.

\fBTab completions will fuzzy\-match files.\fP \fI\%#568\fP
.sp
When tab\-completing a file, fish will first attempt prefix matches
(\fBfoo\fP matches \fBfoobar\fP), then substring matches (\fBooba\fP
matches \fBfoobar\fP), and lastly subsequence matches (\fBfbr\fP matches
\fBfoobar\fP). For example, in a directory with files foo1.txt,
foo2.txt, foo3.txt…, you can type only the numeric part and hit tab
to fill in the rest.
.sp
This feature is implemented for files and executables. It is not yet
implemented for options (like \fB\-\-foobar\fP), and not yet implemented
across path components (like \fB/u/l/b\fP to match \fB/usr/local/bin\fP).

.IP \(bu 2
\fBAutosuggestions\fP\&. Think URL fields in browsers. When you type a
command, fish will suggest the rest of the command after the cursor,
in a muted gray when possible. You can accept the suggestion with the
right arrow key or Ctrl\-F. Suggestions come from command history,
completions, and some custom code for cd; there’s a lot of potential
for improvement here. The suggestions are computed on a background
pthread, so they never slow down your typing. The autosuggestion
feature is incredible. I miss it dearly every time I use anything
else.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBterm256 support\fP where available, specifically modern xterms and
OS X Lion. You can specify colors the old way (‘set_color cyan’) or
by specifying RGB hex values (‘set_color FF3333’); fish will pick the
closest supported color. Some xterms do not advertise term256 support
either in the $TERM or terminfo max_colors field, but nevertheless
support it. For that reason, fish will default into using it on any
xterm (but it can be disabled with an environment variable).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWeb\-based configuration\fP page. There is a new function
‘fish_config’. This spins up a simple Python web server and opens a
browser window to it. From this web page, you can set your shell
colors and view your functions, variables, and history; all changes
apply immediately to all running shells. Eventually all configuration
ought to be supported via this mechanism (but in addition to, not
instead of, command line mechanisms).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMan page completions\fP\&. There is a new function
‘fish_update_completions’. This function reads all the man1 files
from your manpath, removes the roff formatting, parses them to find
the commands and options, and outputs fish completions into
~/.config/fish/completions. It won’t overwrite existing completion
files (except ones that it generated itself).

.IP \(bu 2
fish is now entirely in C++. I have no particular love for C++, but
it provides a ready memory\-model to replace halloc. We’ve made an
effort to keep it to a sane and portable subset (no C++11, no boost,
no going crazy with templates or smart pointers), but we do use the
STL and a little tr1.
.IP \(bu 2
halloc is entirely gone, replaced by normal C++ ownership semantics.
If you don’t know what halloc is, well, now you have two reasons to
be happy.
.IP \(bu 2
All the crufty C data structures are entirely gone. array_list_t,
priority_queue_t, hash_table_t, string_buffer_t have been removed and
replaced by STL equivalents like std::vector, std::map, and
std::wstring. A lot of the string handling now uses std::wstring
instead of wchar_t *
.IP \(bu 2
fish now spawns pthreads for tasks like syntax highlighting that
require blocking I/O.
.IP \(bu 2
History has been completely rewritten. History files now use an
extensible YAML\-style syntax. History “merging” (multiple shells
writing to the same history file) now works better. There is now a
maximum history length of about 250k items (256 * 1024).
.IP \(bu 2
The parser has been “instanced,” so you can now create more than one.
.IP \(bu 2
Total #LoC has shrunk slightly even with the new features.

.SS Performance

.IP \(bu 2
fish now runs syntax highlighting in a background thread, so typing
commands is always responsive even on slow filesystems.
.IP \(bu 2
echo, test, and pwd are now builtins, which eliminates many forks.
.IP \(bu 2
The files in share/functions and share/completions now get
‘internalized’ into C strings that get compiled in with fish. This
substantially reduces the number of files touched at startup. A
consequence is that you cannot change these functions without
recompiling, but often other functions depend on these “standard”
functions, so changing them is perhaps not a good idea anyways.

The large number of forks relative to bash are due to fish’s insanely
expensive default prompt, which is unchanged in my version. If we switch
to a prompt comparable to bash’s (lame) default, the forks drop to 16
with trunk, 4 after our changes.
.sp
The large reduction in lstat() numbers is due to fish no longer needing
to call ttyname() on OS X.
.sp
We’ve got some work to do to be as lean as bash, but we’re on the right
track.
