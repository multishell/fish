.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBfish_add_path\fP is a simple way to add more components to fish\(aqs $PATH. It does this by adding the components either to $fish_user_paths or directly to $PATH (if the \fB\-\-path\fP switch is given).
.sp
It is (by default) safe to use \fBfish_add_path\fP in config.fish, or it can be used once, interactively, and the paths will stay in future because of universal variables\&. This is a "do what I mean" style command, if you need more control, consider modifying the variable yourself.
.sp
Components are normalized by realpath\&. This means that trailing slashes are ignored and relative paths are made absolute (but symlinks are not resolved). If a component already exists, it is not added again and stays in the same place unless the \fB\-\-move\fP switch is given.
.sp
Components are added in the order they are given, and they are prepended to the path unless \fB\-\-append\fP is given (if $fish_user_paths is used, that means they are last in $fish_user_paths, which is itself prepended to $PATH, so they still stay ahead of the system paths).
.sp
If no component is new, the variable ($fish_user_paths or $PATH) is not set again or otherwise modified, so variable handlers are not triggered.
.sp
If a component is not an existing directory, \fBfish_add_path\fP ignores it.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-append\fP causes the components to be added to the \fIend\fP of the variable
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-prepend\fP causes the components to be added to the \fIfront\fP of the variable (this is the default)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP means to use a global $fish_user_paths
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-U\fP or \fB\-\-universal\fP means to use a universal $fish_user_paths \- this is the default if it doesn\(aqt already exist
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-P\fP or \fB\-\-path\fP means to use $PATH directly
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-move\fP means to move already existing components to the place they would be added \- by default they would be left in place and not added again
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-v\fP or \fB\-\-verbose\fP means to print the set command used
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP means to print the \fBset\fP command that would be used without executing it
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fB\-\-move\fP is used, it may of course lead to the path swapping order, so you should be careful doing that in config.fish.
