.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBstring join\fP joins its STRING arguments into a single string separated by SEP, which can be an empty string. Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
\fBstring join0\fP joins its STRING arguments into a single string separated by the zero byte (NUL), and adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction with tools that accept NUL\-delimited input, such as \fBsort \-z\fP\&. Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of \fBstring join0\fP as an \fIargument\fP to a command (via a command substitution) won\(aqt actually work. Fish will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won\(aqt be able to tell where the argument ends. This is a limitation of Unix\(aq argument passing.
